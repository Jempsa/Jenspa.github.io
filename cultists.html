            <p>Cultist priest with 2 warriors: Due to the small size of the location they have to be expected
                everywhere.
            </p>
            <h3>Customs - Spawn change 10%</h3>

        <div class="white-bg">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Cultists lurk in the shadows in groups of 3-5, waiting for a player to approach. They silently approach
                their enemies and stab them using either normal knives or, in case of the priests, the poisoned Cultist
                knife.
                If fired upon, the Cultists will return fire using firearms and grenades. After they attack a player
                with their knife, they may choose to run off into the woods again and attempt to attack the player(s)
                from the shadows once again.
                Some Cultists have been seen to prone in the grass or hide in bushes while their companions engage the
                player(s) with weapons, then attack with their knives when it's least expected.</p>
            <p>As the Cultists prefer to ambush players and are extremely well hidden, they almost always have the
                initiative. Thus, it is important for players to quickly determine exactly where the Cultists are and
                attempt to regain the initiative.
                Cultists appear to always have suppressors and stick to cover, so players must be able to quickly spot
                them in the trees, especially at night.</p>
