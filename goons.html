            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Birdeyes's footsteps make absolutely no noise.</li>
                <li>Killing Goons as a Scav does not carry any penalties towards your Scav karma.</li>
                <li>Goons has different health values than PMCs and Scavs.</li>
                <li>Instead of the typical 4 single slot pockets, they has 5 double slot pockets, bringing their total
                    space to 10 slots.</li>

            <h2>Locations</h2>
            <p>Goons can be found on the following locations:</p>

            <h3>Customs</h3>
            <p>At the Scav base (ZB-013 extraction) building with the numerous mounted weapons.</p>

            <h3>Woods</h3>
            <p>At the antenna in the northwest (Scav Bunker extraction).</p>

            <h3>Shoreline</h3>
            <p>At the weather station on the hill in the southeast.</p>

            <h3>Lighthouse</h3>
            <p>At the water treatment plant in the north, and at the blue chalet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="white-bg">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>When a player is spotted by any one of the Goons, Knight and Big Pipe both rush the player.
                Birdeye seems to sit back and let Knight and Big Pipe push the opposing enemy first. If they do not
                succeed and die, he seems to rush the player. His steps are entirely silent.
                When the goons see you, they'll follow you to the other side of the map, for example, until you're dead.
