            <h2>About Bosses</h2>
            <p>Bosses are powerful enemies with unique gear, traits and behavior in Escape from Tarkov.</p>
            <p>In Escape from Tarkov, there are many bosses that roam the area of besieged Norvinsk. Each boss has
                unique behaviours, characteristics, and tactics. The bosses in Tarkov are feared by players of all
                levels and will often pose as a greater threat than enemy PMCs in the region.
                However, with high risk comes high reward. Many bosses contain high tier loot items or are required to
                eliminate for quests. Learning the patterns, locations, and distinct attire of a boss is often the best
                a player can prepare themselves when a fight begins against a boss in Tarkov.</p>
