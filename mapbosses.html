                <h3>Glukhar - Reserve</h3>
                <p> Spawnchange 26%</p>

                <p>Glukhar has 6 guards with a wide assortment of weapons and gear. He and his many guards are extremely
                    hostile. It's very unlikely to find success while fighting in any open areas.
                    Small hallways and closed rooms are preferable. As for Glukhar, because of his high chest health he
                    can withstand high damage bullets that would otherwise instantly kill other enemies. The only
                    effective means of killing Glukhar quickly are head shots.
                    Glukhar's ASh-12 12.7x55 assault rifle will kill most targets almost instantly.</p>

                <h4>Specific location</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>At the storage buildings marked with "K"</li>
                    <li>At the repair building marked with white knight</li>
                    <li>At the barracks marked with black bishop and black pawn</li>
                    <li>In the underground storage warehouse marked with "Ð”"</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="black-bg" id="Kaban">
            <h3>Kaban - Streets Of Tarkov</h3>
            <p> Spawnchange 26%</p>

            <p>Kaban has 2-3 snipers on the roof of the LexOs area and 6 guards within the compound. Kaban and his
                followers defend LexOs with an extensive array of snipers, emplaced weapons, and patrolling the area
                within LexOs.
                The snipers will patrol the rooftops of the LexOs dealership and LexOs mechanic area, moving between the
                two using an inaccessible gangway. If a sniper engages a PMC, the other snipers may quickly come to
                reinforce the sniper and pin down the player(s).
                The guards within LexOs will patrol the compound between the dealership and mechanic area. At each
                entrance, there is an AGS-30 in the watchtowers and an NSV watching the dangerous chokepoints and
                entrances of the compound.
                These emplacements will often be manned, and a Guard will always man the NSV closest to where PMCs are
                assaulting from. Dismounted guards will take up positions to watch the entrance or will push PMCs at the
                entrances.
                Kaban himself will stay within the dealership or mechanics building, often accompanied by Gus or
                Basmach, or both. If directly engaged by players, he will employ accurate, rapid bursts with his primary
                weapon and may reposition within his building, upstairs, or into the compound.</p>


            <h4>Specific location</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Kaban can be found on the Streets of Tarkov location. He and his guards spawn at the premises of the
                    LexOs car dealership which is riddled with Claymores</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="white-bg" id="Kollontay">
            <h3>Kollontay - Streets Of Tarkov</h3>
            <p> Spawnchange 26%</p>

            <p>Following Kollontay around are 4 guards with a variety of weaponry ranging from shotguns and
                submachineguns, to larger assault rifles with armor piercing bullets.
                While Kollontay has his PR-Taran police baton equipped, currently held weapons of players in his
                proximity forcefully jam due to the effect. Kollontay will draw his baton and charge players if he feels
                players have gotten too close to Kollontay, even if it's around a corner.
                Kollontay's guards will frequently be spread throughout the entire floor, potentially overwhelming
                players from multiple different angles. It is unadvisable to push up the escalators, as this frequently
                places players in the middle of Kollontay's entrouge.
                Instead, slowly peeking from the Northern and Western stairwells to gauge Kollontay's positions,
                combined with grenades, allows for guards to be pulled and killed.
                As with the MVD building, beware Kollontay joining his guards in a push towards players.</p>

            <h4>Specific location</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>At the Klimov shopping mall</li>
                <li>At the ministry of the interior academy</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="black-bg" id="Killa">
            <h3>Killa - Interchange</h3>
            <p> Spawnchange 25%</p>

            <p>Killa uses a light machine gun or other automatic weapon to suppress the enemy, while lurking from cover
                to cover, getting closer to his target for the final push. During the assault he moves in a zig-zag
                pattern, uses smoke and fragmentation grenades, and relentlessly suppresses enemies with automatic fire.
                He will follow his target large distances out of his patrol route, so be sure to run very far to get
                away from him if he has locked onto you.It is recommended to avoid being spotted by Killa. He has
                multiple grenades and is generally accurate with his bursts. If you are close to him he will
                continuously push the player and relentlessly hunt them until he ambushes and assaults them.
                It is best to attack him with high-penetration ammunition such as 5.45 BS, 5.56 M995, or 7.62x51.
                Without proper ammunition to kill him, shredding his 6B13 M to low durability or firing solely at his
                legs are both appropriate, albeit more risky, strategies.
                Grenades generally won't work to kill him, as he is a highly mobile fighter and will rarely be pinned
                down long enough for a grenade to stop him. If fighting him with a teammate, attacking him from two
                different directions and peeking cover is a sound strategy, as he will continue to suppress one of his
                opponents while the other can safely return fire.</p>

            <h4>Specific location</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In the IDEA, OLI and Goshan stores.</li>
                <li>Around the center stores on the first and second floor of the mall.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="white-bg" id="Reshala">
            <h3>Reshala - Customs</h3>
            <p> Spawnchange 26%</p>

            <p>Following Reshala around are 4 heavily armed guards. To kill Reshala first, the best tactic is to find
                him before being seen. He can be easily identified by his brown sweater, unlike his followers who wear
                blue jackets with white striped cuffs. After being spotted he will run behind his guards, forcing you to
                kill them first.
                Before spending time looting Reshala or his guards it's recommended that you kill all five of them as
                they will usually stay within close proximity to each other and will kill you while looting. The guards
                are very aggressive compared to normal scavs and will rush the player.
                When facing these guards be aware of their positions so you do not get caught off guard when they run up
                to you. Since the guards are frequently in close proximity to each other, grenades can be highly
                effective at stunning or killing multiple of them at once.</p>
            <h4>Specific location</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>At the dorms area, either in one of the dorms or in the yard between them</li>
                <li>At the new gas station, either inside or around it. He sometimes wanders off over the grassy hills
                    towards the checkpoint.</li>
                <li>At the Scav base (ZB-013 extraction) building with the numerous mounted weapons</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="black-bg" id="Sanitar">
            <h3>Sanitar - Shoreline</h3>
            <p> Spawnchange 26%</p>

            <p>Following Sanitar are 2-3 well-armed and armored guards. When engaged in combat, he will fight alongside
                his fellow scavs and guards, but may often break away to heal or inject himself.
                He has plenty of meds, so a prolonged engagement is possible. When contact is made with Sanitar and his
                guards, the player should attempt to kill them without giving them the chance to break-off and heal. As
                all the guards are heavily armored, have several means of healing themselves, can carry several
                injectors, damage made by the players may be negated quickly by the guards.
                As with other Bosses, they carry several grenades and do not shy away from using them, so exercise
                caution when playing with a group.While the standard scavs that surround Sanitar are not as dangerous as
                his guards, they may still pose a threat, sneaking up on players and hitting them in vulnerable
                locations or distracting the players while Sanitar or his guards flank you.
                Care should be taken to avoid rushing into a large group of scavs in addition to Sanitar and his men.
            </p>

            <h4>Specific location</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In the east and west wing of the health resort</li>
                <li>At the port/pier area.</li>
                <li>Near the cottages</li>

        <div class="white-bg" id="Shturman">
            <h3>Shturman - Woods</h3>
            <p> Spawnchange 26%</p>

            <p>Shturman and his two guards will engage the player at a long range protecting the sawmill area of the
                woods. They prefer to keep their distance, as they are not suited for close quarters combat. They also
                like to take positions between hard cover, or camouflage themselves with the environment.
                Additionally, it is not unheard of for one of the guards to flank or rush the player(s) while Shturman
                and the other guard hold positions and keep the player(s) pinned down.It is also good to note that
                Shturman will fire warning shots (Usually 3-5) before locking onto his target,
                these warning shots only occur if the target is far enough away where they pose no immediate threat to
                Shturman himself. When both followers are killed Shturman tends to take shelter in places like wooden
                barracks. </p>

            <h4>Specific location</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Shturman can be found on the Woods location. He and his guards spawn at the sawmill that is located
                    right next to big lake in the south:</li>

        <div class="black-bg" id="Tagilla">
            <h3>Tagilla - Factory</h3>

            <p> Spawnchange 24% and the night time 25%</p>
            <p>Tagilla is the easiest boss to fight if you know what you are doing. Tagilla have a big hammer.He is
                batshit insane and will attempt to hammer you down. However, if you are in a position that he cannot
                path-find to, such as the rafters, he will use his secondary weapon (usually a shotgun) to kill you from
                a distance.
                He's active immediately at the start of raid. The boss can set ambushes, open suppressive fire, and
                breach if needed. If you are using high penetrating ammunition, aim for his head, not his thorax. If you
                have low pen or high flesh damage, aim for his stomach since his armor only covers the thorax. The best
                plan of action is to bait out his swing so he's standing still, then shoot him.
                If you shoot while he's running at you, he'll just charge through it and absolutely murder you, so wait
                until he swings to shoot. Tagillas welding masks do not protect his nape, therefore you can try to shoot
                him there. </p>

            <h4>Specific location</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tagilla can be found on the Factory location. Due to the small size of the location he has to be
                    expected everywhere.</li>
